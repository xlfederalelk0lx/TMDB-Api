     *
     * Discover also supports a nice list of sort options. See below for all of the available options.
     *
     * Please note, when using certification \ certification.lte you must also specify certification_country. These two parameters work together in order to filter the results. You can only filter results with the countries we have added to our certifications list.
     *
     * If you specify the region parameter, the regional release date will be used instead of the primary release date. The date returned will be the first date based on your query (ie. if a with_release_type is specified). It's important to note the order of the release types that are used. Specifying "2|3" would return the limited theatrical release date as opposed to "3|2" which would return the theatrical date.
